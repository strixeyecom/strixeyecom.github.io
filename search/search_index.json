For this, we developed Trigger and Integration mechanisms. Basically, Triggers are set of rules. Integrations are actions when a Trigger Rule is triggered. For example, you create an Email Integration, and you create a Trigger Rule. When a Suspect detected and this Trigger Rule triggered, you get an email about this Suspect. Create Integration \u00b6 To create an Integration, go to Integrations > Create New Integration Then, select an Integration type. Notification Integrations \u00b6 Notification Integrations are pasive integrations. For example, when a Suspect detected, Slack Integration sends a message to Slack channel. Select a Notification Integration (e.g. Slack) and create an Integration. After creation, you must verify it. Visit the Integration detail page and click the Integrate button. If successfully integrated, you can start using it. Incident Response Integrations \u00b6 Incident Response integrations are active Integrations. For example, when a Suspect detected, Cloudflare Integration block this Suspect. Select a Incident Response Integration (e.g. Cloudflare) and create an Integration. After creation, you must verify it. Visit the Integration detail page and click the Integrate button. First of all, create a custom Cloudflare API token from Cloudflare Dashboard with Zone Firewall Edit permission. Secondly, create a Cloudflare Integration with this API token and your Cloudflare Zone ID. Lastly, verify the Integration from Integration detail page.
